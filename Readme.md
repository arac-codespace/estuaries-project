"Develop  field  maps  to  locate  aquifer  points  of  discharge  in  collaboration  with the Research Advisory Committee. 
The Research Advisory Committee recommended initiating this effort by identifying the points  where  changes  in  salinity  have  been  observed,  and  analyzing  historical events that may explain those changes. To date, a reduction in salinity has been observed at  stations 19 and 20. This could indicate seepage, and should be further monitored."
